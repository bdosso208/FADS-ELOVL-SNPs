SNPs impacting PUFA metabolism
Diets enriched in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) like y-linolenic acid (GLA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 
docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) have been recommended for their immunomodulatory effects, but conflicting results regarding 
their benefit remain. We hypothesize that genetic variants impacting PUFA metabolism contribute to variable responses 
to PUFA-enriched diets.#
